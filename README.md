# Language Evolution Simulator
# What is this?
This is the codebase I created from scratch in my second year of study in for an independent research project I undertook with Dr. Geoff Nitschke aimed at contributing to the field of Computational Linguistics and Evolutionary Linguistics. 

The simulator was created in order to observe the process of linguistic agreement and eventual langauge convergence amongst a group of artificial agents. 

# Tech
- Evolutionary Algorithm (see AgentGenome.java and Population.java)
- ALife simulation

# Running the simulator
The entirety of this project's codebase was created and run in IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment. Therefore, while this project is not recommended to be run on just any machine due to the data collection process creating many textfiles, it is preferable to be run using an IDE. 

In ordert to run the code, access the test.java class and specify what parameters you wish to see language evolve under (i.e amount of each agent type).
